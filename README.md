# Standardized Emission and Waste Inventories (StEWI)

StEWI is a collection of Python modules that provide processed USEPA emission and waste generation inventory data in standard tabular formats.
 The standard outputs may be further aggregated or filtered based on given criteria, and can be combined based on common facility and flows
  across the inventories.

StEWI consists of a core module, `stewi`, that digests and provides the USEPA inventory data in standard formats. Two matcher modules, the `facilitymatcher`
and `chemicalmatcher`, provide commons IDs for facilities and flows across inventories, which is used by the `stewicombo` module
to combine the data, and optionally remove overlaps and remove double counting of groups of chemicals based on user preferences.

## Standard output formats

The core `stewi` module produces the following output formats:

[Flow-By-Facility](./format%20specs/FlowByFacility.md): Each row represents the total amount of release or waste of a single type in a given year from the given facility.

[Flow-By-Process](./format%20specs/FlowByProcess.md): Each row represents the total amount of release or waste of a single type in a given year from a specific process within the given facility. Applicable only to NEI and GHGRP.

[Facility](./format%20specs/Facility.md): Each row represents a unique facility in a given inventory and given year

[Flow](./format%20specs/Flow.md): Each row represents a unique flow (substance or waste) in a given inventory and given year

The `chemicalmatcher` module produces:

[Chemical Matches](./format%20specs/ChemicalMatches.md): Each row provides a common identifier for an inventory flow chemical

The `facilitymatcher` module produces:

[Facility Matches](./format%20specs/FacilityMatches.md): Each row provides a common identifier for an inventory facility

The `stewicombo` module produces:

[Flow-By-Facility Combined](./format%20specs/FlowByFacilityCombo.md): Analagous to the flowbyfacility, with chemical and facilitymatches added

## Data Processing

The following describes details related to dataset access and processing specific to each dataset

### DMR

Processing of the DMR uses the custom search option of the [Water Pollutant Loading Tool](https://echo.epa.gov/trends/loading-tool/get-data/custom-search/) with the following parameters:
- Parameter grouping: On - applies a parameter grouping function to avoid double-counting loads for pollutant parameters that represent the same pollutant
- Detection limit: Half - set all non-detects to Â½ the detection limit
- Estimation: On - estimates loads when monitoring data are not reported for one or more monitoring periods in a reporting year
- Nutrient Aggregation: On - Nitrogen and Phosphorous flows are converted to N and P equivalents

### eGRID

eGRID data are sourced from EPA's [eGRID](https://www.epa.gov/egrid) site

### GHGRP

GHGRP data are sourced from EPA's [Envirofacts](https://enviro.epa.gov/)

### NEI

NEI data are downloaded from the EPA Emissions Inventory System (EIS) Gateway and hosted on EPA [Data Commons](https://edap-ord-data-commons.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=stewi/) for access by StEWI

### RCRAInfo

RCRAInfo data are sourced from the [Public Data Files](https://rcrapublic.epa.gov/rcrainfoweb/action/main-menu/view)

### TRI

TRI data are sourced from the [Basic Plus Data files](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-data-and-tools)

## Installation Instructions

Install a release directly from github using pip. From a command line interface, run:
> pip install git+https://github.com/USEPA/standardizedinventories.git@v0.9.8#egg=standardizedinventories

where you can replace 'v0.9.8' with the version you wish to use under [Releases](https://github.com/USEPA/standardizedinventories/releases).

Alternatively, to install from the most current point on the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/USEPA/standardizedinventories.git
cd standardizedinventories
pip install . # or pip install -e . for devs
```
The current version contains optional dependencies (`selenium` and `webdriver_manager`) to download RCRAInfo data using a chrome browswer interface prior to generating those stewi inventories.
See details in [RCRAInfo.py](https://github.com/USEPA/standardizedinventories/blob/master/stewi/RCRAInfo.py) for how to generate those inventories without these optional libraries.
 
To download these optional dependencies use one of the following pip install commands:

```
pip install .["RCRAInfo"]
```

or

```
pip install . -r requirements.txt -r rcrainfo_requirements.txt 
```
