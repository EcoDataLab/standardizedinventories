In some situations over 80 wells are associated with a facility.  To count the components on this numbers of wells would be overly burdensome, especially when a subset of wells could be counted and the average number of components for that subset could easily be applied to all the wells for the facility.       The “Counts” parameter will be estimated based on a population component count at a subset of wells (at least 10% and not fewer than 8 wells) and extrapolation for total well count. ",

Vernon Compressor Station,1003435,2013,Onshore natural gas transmission compression [98.230(a)(4)], ,CentrifugalCompressorsDetails,5.4,1.964,0.0,Yes,"1) According to 40 CFR 98.233(o)(1)(iii)(A):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.  2) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.  Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.",

Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.  2) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Shell applied BAMM throughout 2013 for GOR for one sub-basin based on a facility wide average GOR due to lack of composition data for that sub-basin.  Shell applied BAMM throughout 2013 for Vp,q - Volume of oil produced in calendar year for well p in sub-basin q.  Vp,q was estimated based on company records of the volume of oil produced during flowback operations at oil wells.  The company records applied included flow meter data, but that flow meter data is considered BAMM because Shell could not confirm QA/QC of the flow meter data.",

The survey was performed utilizing an opitcal gas imagining instrument. The instrument was a ThermaCAM GAsFindIR HSX infrared (IR) gas imaging camera, manufactured by FLIR Systems with a nominal spectra range of 3-5 um, that is capable of identifiying gaseous methane emissions by providing real time images of the surveyed source and the gas plume. Any equipment leak identified by the IR camera was then subsequently screened using Method 21 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A-7) to determine the concentration (in parts per million by volume [ppmv] of the leak. The instrument used to perform the Method 21 screening was a thermo scientific toxic vapor analyzer (TVA) 1000B which offers flame ionization detector (FID). Pursuant to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance (www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads11/documents/Subpart-W-additional-faq.pdf), the equipment leak detection monitoring survey was limited to equipment components in LNG liquid storage tank (LNG Terminal) and excluded components in gas service. According to Method 21, a concentration of methane of 10,000 ppm or greater was considered a leak.",

Panola Compressor Station,1003287,2013,Onshore natural gas transmission compression [98.230(a)(4)], ,CentrifugalCompressorsDetails,1.9,2.784,0.0,Yes,"1) According to 40 CFR 98.233(o)(1)(iii)(A):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.  2) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Delhi (SESH) Compressor Station,1004995,2013,Onshore natural gas transmission compression [98.230(a)(4)], ,CentrifugalCompressorsDetails,1.3,0.48,0.0,Yes,"1) According to 40 CFR 98.233(o)(1)(iii)(A):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.  2) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.  Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.

This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.  Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.",

Chandler Compressor Station/Wilburton Compressor Station,1003211,2013,Onshore natural gas transmission compression [98.230(a)(4)], ,ReciprocatingCompressorsDetails,64.8,201.752,0.0,Yes," 1) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.  Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.  2) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.  Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.

Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.  Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.",

Perryville Compressor Station,1003298,2013,Onshore natural gas transmission compression [98.230(a)(4)], ,CentrifugalCompressorsDetails,3.3,1.2,0.0,Yes,"1) According to 40 CFR 98.233(o)(1)(iii)(A):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.  2) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.  2) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

Westdale Compressor Station,1003436,2013,Onshore natural gas transmission compression [98.230(a)(4)], ,CentrifugalCompressorsDetails,0.3,0.12,0.0,Yes,"1) According to 40 CFR 98.233(o)(1)(iii)(A):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.  2) In both equations W-23 and W-27, the GHGi specified to be used for transmission facilities is 100% instead of the 95% for methane and 1% for CO2 defaults as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u) that is referenced for MTm in equations W-22 and W-26.  Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions.  Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas.  2) According to 40 CFR 98.233(p)(3)(i):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years if this mode is not found in the annual measurement.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.
