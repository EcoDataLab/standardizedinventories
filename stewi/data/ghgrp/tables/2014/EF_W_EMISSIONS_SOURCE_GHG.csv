Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.

The emission rates are therefore based on the averages emissions rate of rod packing vents, blowdown valves, and isolation valves measured at other DCP facilities during 2014; this is based on engineering calculations.  The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2014 reporting year.",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns.  Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns.  Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.  Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

The emission rates are therefore based on the averages emissions rate of rod packing vents, blowdown valves, and isolation valves measured at other DCP facilities during 2014; this is based on engineering calculations.  The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2014 reporting year. A compressor was added towards the beginning of the year, and the throughput of each compressor is an engineering estimate based on compressor design and time in operation.",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

The emission rates are therefore based on the averages emissions rate of rod packing vents, blowdown valves, and isolation valves measured at other DCP facilities during 2014; this is based on engineering calculations.  The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2014 reporting year. In the middle of the year the configuration of the compressors changed slightly. This configuration was used to calculate emissions for the whole year of 2014.",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters.  Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes.  ",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

The wet seal degassing valve leakage rate, blowdown valve leakage emission rate, and isolation valve leakage rate is an average of the blowdown valve emissions rates surveyed at other DCP Midstream facilities during the 2014 reporting year; this is based on engineering calculations. The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2014 reporting year. The throughput of each compressor is an engineering estimate based on compressor design and time in operation.",

Delhi (SESH) Compressor Station,1004995,2014,Onshore natural gas transmission compression [98.230(a)(4)], ,CentrifugalCompressorsDetails,0.0,1.236,0.0,Yes,"According to 40 CFR 98.233(o)(1)(iii)(A):  For the not operating, depressurized mode, each compressor must be measured at least once in any three consecutive calendar years.    To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Using 100% for CH4 and CO2 for modes not tested and required to use the emission factors significantly overestimates emissions. Instead of using 100% for GHGi in equations W-23 and W-27 for both CH4 and CO2 for transmission facilities, we would like to use the defaults of 95% for CH4 and 1% for CO2 as outlined in section 40 CFR 98.233(u).  This will eliminate the excessive overestimation of emissions as the defaults are more representative of actual mole fractions found in natural gas. ",

The emission rates are therefore based on the averages emissions rate of rod packing vents, blowdown valves, and isolation valves measured at other DCP facilities during 2014; this is based on engineering calculations.  The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2014 reporting year.",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

The survey was performed on December 23, 2014 using Method 21 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A-7) to determine the concentration (in parts per million by volume [ppmv] of the leak. The instrument used to perform the Method 21 screening was a thermo scientific toxic vapor analyzer (TVA) 1000B which offers flame ionization detector (FID). Pursuant to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance (www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads11/documents/Subpart-W-additional-faq.pdf), the equipment leak detection monitoring survey was limited to equipment components in LNG liquid storage tank (LNG Terminal) and excluded components in gas service. According to Method 21, a concentration of methane of 10,000 ppm or greater was considered a leak.",

Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

The emission rates are therefore based on the averages emissions rate of rod packing vents, blowdown valves, and isolation valves measured at other DCP facilities during 2014; this is based on engineering calculations.  The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2014 reporting year.",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-24 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

The wet seal degassing valve leakage rate, blowdown valve leakage emission rate, and isolation valve leakage rate is an average of the blowdown valve emissions rates surveyed at other DCP Midstream facilities during the 2014 reporting year; this is based on engineering calculations. The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2014 reporting year.",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

Vent logs are a longstanding practice for natural gas transmission compressor stations, but the number of blowdowns and total released volume are the only parameters usually provided on those logs.  Additional time is needed to implement new procedures for tracking and calculating emissions from blowdowns using these parameters. Current blowdown vent calculation methods will be used.  Process temperature and pressure parameters will be based on engineering estimates using best available information.  Total vented emissions and number of events will be reported rather than reporting by unique volumes. ",

To be able to do this would require multiple compressors to be shut down and blown down in order to take this measurement, resulting in additional, unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, placing operating compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode could result in pressure buildups in transmission lines if gas cannot be rerouted through other compressors or stations in the area, resulting in safety concerns. Current compressor mode calculations will be used.  Instead of placing the compressors in the not operating, depressurized mode to take a measurement, the company emission factor outlined in Equation W-28 will be used for compressors not found in the not operating, depressurized mode during the annual survey.

Shell implemented a QA/QC flow meter process during 2014 where available applied metered data.  For all flares without verified QA/QC, engineering estimates based on best available data were used to determine the volumes of gas routed to flare, even for flares with continuous flow meters.  Shell has applied BAMM throughout 2014 to determine the composition of certain streams that are routed to flare.  Shell applied a facility wide average composition for heater treater (HT), free water knock out (FWKO), and truck loading emission streams because of the limited composition datasets available.

The operating mode measured is assumed to be the mode that the compressor operated in during the majority of the 2014 reporting year.
